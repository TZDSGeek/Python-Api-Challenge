# Python-Api-Challenge

I was able to complete the majority of this assignement by referencing the content covered in this course. I did recieve guidance from a Tutor for the VacationPy section of the assignment, however my code was original, they just provided guidance when I needed assistance. I also utilized stackoverflow,ASKBCS, and the relevant software documentation in order to troubleshoot errors and further my understanding in the application of certain functions. I also looked at a previous example of this assignment to compare the results and efficiciency of my coding.
